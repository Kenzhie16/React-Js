            <p>Hi my name is Kenn Elaco but they often call me "BABY"</p>

            <p>I live in 2836 MacLaren Street, Ottawa, Canada</p>

            <p>The interesting about me is that I don't know my hidden talent since it is hidden</p>

            <p>My motto in life is: "If others can do it, let them do it"</p>
